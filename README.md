# Sycole

Sycole is a jailbreaking tool for iOS that is currently under development. We plan to support iOS 14.0 - iOS 14.3. This jailbreak will be either a semi-untethered jailbreak or an untethered jailbreak.

# Future Plans and Possibilities

It is possible that we may add support for all iOS 13 versions along with our iOS 14 support.
