# Sycole

Sycole is a jailbreaking tool for iOS that is currently under development. We plan to support iOS 14.0 - iOS 14.3. This jailbreak will be either a semi-untethered jailbreak or an untethered jailbreak.

# Future Plans and Possibilities

It is possible that we may add support for all iOS 13 versions along with our iOS 14 support.

# Release ETA

We are unsure of when we will release Sycole V1. When we are further in the development stage, we will release more information about this.

# Open Source

Will this be open source? We are not sure if we will make this project open source or not. More information will be provided about this as we get further in the development stage.

# If we release a V2, what happens to V1?

Even if V1 is not open source and yet we release a V2, we will most likely release the source of V1.
